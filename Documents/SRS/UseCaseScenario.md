##Seat Planning System

The Seat Planning System (SPS) is proposed by Institute of Information Technology (IIT), University of Dhaka (DU). SPS is a web based software application that will be used to automate the existing manual seat planning system. 
 
For using this system, user needs to register with e-mail address and password. After registering user needs to verify his email address by clicking link sent to that email address. Then user can log into the system using email and password. After that he or she will be allowed to create seat plan..  
 
Seat Planning System will take roll numbers, room number,rooms size in maximum rows and columns, students email addresses(optional), number of students to be placed in a column(optional) as input and will randomize rolls and map them to seats so that no adjacent roll students are placed nearby of a roll placed in a seat.In Case of uneven rows and columns one will have to mention that which row or column with its size. After placing seats user can modify the seat plan by exchanging rolls between seats or with dummy seat. Seat Planning System will also take teachers name who will perform duty on that room. After randomizing and allocating seats, user will be given choice whether he wants to send seat plan to students (if email addresses of students are provided).

##Seat Planning System

The Seat Planning System(SPS) is proposed by Institute of Information Technology (IIT), University of Dhaka(DU). SPS is a web based software application that will be used to automate the existing manual seat planning system.
Admin, assigned by IIT will administer this system. Admin enter available room number, maximum row and column number for each room, unavailable seat index for each room and number of students have to be seated with their exam roll.
SPS will randomly generate a seat plan in such a way that adjacent rolls are not placed within neighboring seats. Seat plan will have the exam roll and room number mentioned in it. SPS ensure that there will be no modification due to penetration. Our system will provide printable document of generated seat planning.


###Questions:
1. Will there be any system admin who will manage the system or just authentication and use by anyone?
2. Exam committee members needs to log in?  Or it needs to be universal so that anyone can access?
3. Input or file like csv/excel?
4. Send email to students so that they know their positions?(*nearby seated students may prepare themselves accordingly *)
5. Is the allocation of seat random or any algorithm will be implemented?
6. What will be the method of allocation if a room contain odd number of rows or columns or both? What if any seat is missing?
